App that maps Yelp locations along a route instead of just a single point

This is a completed project that I am now refactoring, so it is a little messy and is a work in progress. It is an app that takes in an origin, a destination, and a yelp search term (such as 'restaurant' or 'grocery store'), and then maps out Yelp search results along the route from the origin to the destination. It is handy when you are headed somewhere and want to know stores or restaurants that are 'along the way'.
