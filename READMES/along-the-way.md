#Along the Way

##Summary
This is a completed project that I am now  refactoring, so it is a little messy and is  a work in progress. It is an app that takes in an origin, a destination, and a yelp search term (such as 'restaurant' or 'grocery store'), and then maps out Yelp search results along the route from origin to destination. It is handy when you are headed somewhere and want to know stores or restaurants that are 'along the way'.
