#Along the Way
#aka Yelp-A-Route on Heroku

##Summary
This is an app that takes in an origin, a destination, and a yelp search term (such as 'restaurant' or 'grocery store'), and then maps out Yelp results of that search term along the route from origin to destination. It is handy when you are headed somewhere and want to know stores or restaurants that are 'along the way' as opposed to a single point, as they are currently displayed in the Yelp or Google Maps app.
